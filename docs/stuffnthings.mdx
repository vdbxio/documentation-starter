### Overview

Add LED or general PWM switching to the common PCA9685 servo board. You may not need 16 servos in your project, so this board will add basic N-Channel switching to one of the 4-channel banks. Also compatible with ESPHome to add dimmable DC lighting into Home Assistant.

Input power is provided separately and can be up to 32v for integration with 24v battery systems. Each MOSFET is rated for about 7w of dissipation (datasheet attached) and terminates at a standard 2P x 2.54mm header for use with Dupont/Molex connectors.
